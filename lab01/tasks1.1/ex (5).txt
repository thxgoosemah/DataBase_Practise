Minimum set of attributes for the primary key:
{StudentID, CourseCode, Section, Semester, Year}

Explanation:

StudentID — identifies the student.

CourseCode — identifies the course.

Section — distinguishes different groups of the same course in the same semester.

Semester, Year — specify the exact term; needed since a student can retake the same course in different semesters.

Additional candidate keys:

No other minimal keys under the current rules.

Possible alternatives:

{StudentID, CourseCode, Semester, Year} — if students are not allowed to enroll in multiple sections of the same course in one semester.

A surrogate key (e.g., RegistrationID) could also serve as a candidate key.
