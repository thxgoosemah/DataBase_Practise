I would choose EmpID as the primary key, because:

It is specifically designed as an internal unique identifier.

Unlike SSN, it avoids privacy/security issues.

Unlike Email or Phone, it won’t change if the employee changes their contact details.

It is short, numeric, and stable → best suited for primary key use.
