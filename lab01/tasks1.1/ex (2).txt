EmpID (unique company identifier)

SSN (unique to each person by law)

Email (unique per employee email address)

Phone (appears unique in sample data, but not guaranteed in real life)

So the candidate keys are:

{EmpID}

{SSN}

{Email}

{Phone} (if we assume the company policy enforces one phone per employee)
